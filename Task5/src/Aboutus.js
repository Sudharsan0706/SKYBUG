            <p>Founded a decade ago, Paint Artist was ahead of its time, bringing
                 to the art world a number of 'firsts'. It was the first platform
                 to democratize the art buying process, while also empowering the
                 artist; the first platform with a completely transparent pricing
                 and purchase process; the first platform to proactively help collectors
                 re-sell their art. It was the first portal to bring on board galleries
                 and dealers, art critics and writers alike â€“ to bring art to every home.
                 It is now also the first art portal in the country to be backed by cutting-edge
                 technology and data to drive its unique art selection and display process</p>
